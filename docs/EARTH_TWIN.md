# NotationsOS Earth Twin

Related backend increment (2026-09-06): [local recorded-observation replay](RECORDED_OBSERVATION_REPLAY.md) verifies declared clocks, local Cartesian transforms and exact evidence references through a separate operator CLI. Its synthetic tests and unadmitted estimates do not enter this globe or establish geographic registration. [Boreas qualification](RECORDED_DATASET_QUALIFICATION.md) records the real-data adapter and acceptance work still absent.

The Earth Twin is the projection fabric's geodetic instrument: the surface on which NotationsOS realizes, on the Earth, whatever it can honestly place there. It is the CesiumJS role the [synthesized architecture](SYNTHESIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md) assigns ("where does this exist, and how does it move through geographic space and time?"), built on the globe stack of [God's Eye View](https://github.com/notationsystems/gods-eye-view) and held to NotationsOS's rules: every layer names its source and its state, nothing is invented, nothing is acquired that has not been registered and decided, and a fixture is called a fixture. It lives at `/earth`, under Inquiry.

This document records what the twin is, what it accompanies, what was taken from God's Eye View and what was deliberately not, the staged plan, the truths the design does not bend, and the verification receipt. Present tense throughout: what the code does today.

## What it is built from

| | Pinned |
|---|---|
| Globe stack | God's Eye View at commit `6d83bb6008738db2aa067284586be04ea0c5eabb` (2026-08-31), MIT for the source code only; its bundled and fetched data keep their own terms |
| Engine | CesiumJS 1.124.0, Apache-2.0, installed as a dependency for its types and its static build; that build (the prebuilt ES module, workers, bundled imagery, widget stylesheet, third-party workers) is copied by `scripts/earth-assets.mjs` into `public/cesium` before every `dev` and `build`, git-ignored, and served from this origin only. The page loads the engine's module from there at runtime rather than bundling it, so there is exactly one copy of the engine and the application bundle carries none of it |
| Surface | Natural Earth II imagery bundled with the engine (public domain) on the WGS84 ellipsoid, no terrain; coarse by design |
| Source list | `DATA_SOURCES.md` at blob `68241fbef4c51796e43cc5a172b91131f5305941`, carried as a registry of names and terms |

Everything the twin is as data lives in `src/domain/earth.ts`: the origin pin, the engine, the layers with their states, the registry, the view codec, the projection request builder, and what the twin does not claim.

The engine version is NotationsOS's explicit pin, not a claim to reproduce the upstream dependency lock: God's Eye View declares `^1.124.0`, but its [lockfile at the pinned commit](https://github.com/notationsystems/gods-eye-view/blob/6d83bb6008738db2aa067284586be04ea0c5eabb/package-lock.json) resolves CesiumJS 1.138.0. The registry carries the 21 rows of that commit's live-source table, not an exhaustive census of its runtime; NASA FIRMS is described elsewhere in the same source document. The upstream simplified Natural Earth **vector datasets** are not the engine's bundled Natural Earth II **imagery**, and neither supplies precise corpus geometry.

## The derivation beneath the globe

The twin draws positions; it does not read them. `src/components/earth/SpatialKeys.tsx`,
rendered below the globe from the same release, is the first thing in this
repository that derives from space rather than displaying it: a geohash cell key
for every declared position at the finest resolution the source's own stated
horizontal uncertainty supports and no finer, a refusal where the source stated
none, and a verdict per cross-subject pair on whether the two positions can be
told apart at all. The design, the disciplines and what is deliberately absent
are in [Space as a working dimension](SPATIAL_DERIVATION.md).

## What it accompanies

The five fabrics each meet the twin in a specific way, and today only two of them have anything to draw.

- **Projection.** The twin is the `GLOBE / GEODETIC / GLOBAL_3D` route made real. It asks the existing read-only compiler (`POST /api/projections/preview`) for one explicit record of the latest committed release, under the release's own commitments, at the release cutoff and the record's own validity start. The compiler answers `READY` with `geometry.positions` when the record's own subject declares a `location.position` record that passes the same gate as the record itself, and `UNAVAILABLE: GEOMETRY_NOT_AVAILABLE` otherwise, because it invents none ([Declared geometry](PROJECTION_FABRIC.md#declared-geometry)). The twin draws each returned position as a point coloured by the declaring source's interest, with the stated horizontal uncertainty as a ring and, in the label, the subject, the declared value, the source's interest and the records placed there (several records at one declared position share one point and one label, because the position is what is drawn); it lists the declaration beside the record with its source, evidence class, both clocks and status, and flies the camera straight above the position, at a regional height where the bundled surface still shows where on Earth it is, when the record is chosen. A record whose subject declares nothing is shown with the compiler's refusal and drawn nowhere. "Place every record" asks the compiler once per record of the release, each at its own validity start, and reports how many were placed, how many stand unplaced and how many the compiler refused to select, so the globe shows everything the release can honestly put on it and nothing else. A record the compiler will not select shows the refusal code and what it means, and no more, so nothing withheld is disclosed. The compiler's `rendererExecuted: false` non-claim stays true of the compiler; the twin is the renderer, and it says so.
- **Acquisition.** The twenty-one sources in God's Eye View's pinned live-source table (aircraft, vessels, satellites, earthquakes, cameras, traffic, weather, headlines, radio, terrain, and the metered photorealistic tiles) are carried as a registry with their terms class, their attribution and what they would supply. Each is `NOT_INTEGRATED` with its blockers named: no source registration, no rights decision requested, no connector on the rail, and where the terms exclude commercial operation or meter a key, that too. None is contacted. A source enters the twin only the way anything enters NotationsOS: registered, decided, captured with a receipt, normalized under a contract.
- **Corpus.** A position is a corpus record: `location.position`, for one subject over one validity interval, with its own evidence class, provenance, rights, visibility and both clocks, committed in the release digest like any other record. The demonstration corpus declares two, both synthetic declarations at real port coordinates that assert nothing about any real cargo: lot 5B-221 at its loading terminal, from the port custody system (disinterested), and lot 7C-104 at the claimant's origination yard, from the claimant's own yard log (self-reported). Records reach the globe only through the compiler, with rights, visibility and both times enforced there. Before sending selector metadata to the browser, `src/earth/records.ts` reuses the existing `deliverableRecords` gate for `COUNTERPARTY_SHARED` at the release cutoff. It sends only selectable IDs, titles, subjects, predicates and validity bounds; withheld records, their counts and refusal reasons are not serialized. This is not a second policy implementation or a second corpus. Every projection request is still decided by the compiler, including historical correction and retraction semantics. The twin holds no second copy of the corpus and no second gate: clicking a drawn point selects a record it was drawn for, and nothing more is read from the globe.
- **State.** Notations and relations carry no geodetic position in the kernel's closed command set, so the authored-marks layer is `UNAVAILABLE` and says why. A geodetic command would be a backend contract request, like the evidence-reference commands in [Notation workspace](NOTATION_WORKSPACE.md).
- **Compute and decision.** Nothing yet. A case or a ruling has no position either.

## Layers and their states

| Layer | State | Source | Draws |
|---|---|---|---|
| Earth surface | `BUNDLED` | Natural Earth II bundled with CesiumJS, WGS84 ellipsoid, no terrain | The globe, at the bundled resolution |
| Day and night | `COMPUTED` | The sun's position at the twin's world time, from the engine's own ephemeris; exact once the Earth-orientation data served with the engine has loaded, and labelled as an approximation until then | Lighting, the terminator, the sub-solar point as a view preset |
| Corpus records | `FIXTURE` | The projection compiler over one exact release | A selected record at every position its subject's own `location.position` record declares under the same gate, coloured by the declaring source's interest, with the stated uncertainty as a ring; a record whose subject declares none is listed as unplaced with the refusal |
| World signals | `NOT_INTEGRATED` | The pinned registry | Nothing: no connector, no rights decision |
| Authored marks | `UNAVAILABLE` | The notation kernel | Nothing: no geodetic command |

The state vocabulary is closed (`BUNDLED`, `COMPUTED`, `FIXTURE`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `NOT_INTEGRATED`) and each state's meaning is shown on hover. It is the twin's version of God's Eye View's live / delayed / simulated / unavailable discipline, with the states NotationsOS actually has.

## Time

The twin has two clocks and labels both. **Known at** is the release cutoff: nothing knowable later appears. **World time** is the instant the Earth is shown at: day and night are computed from it, and the corpus is asked for what held then. World time follows the selected record's validity start, so the request the compiler receives is always within the record's validity and the picture on the globe is the world at that instant.

A replacement viewer receives the latest selected world time before becoming `READY`. Runtime status, camera callbacks and asynchronous sub-solar results belong to one viewer instance; late work from a destroyed instance cannot update its replacement. Projection answers are bound to the entire serialized request, including source/release commitments and both clocks, so a previous release's answer is not shown under a new release.

## What the drawn positions imply

Drawing two points says nothing. The twin makes exactly one derivation over
the geometry it draws, and it is deliberately the weakest claim the
declarations support: **can the standing accounts of where a subject is all
be right at once?**

The declarations are grouped by the identity the compiler resolved, not by
proximity — nothing here resolves an identity — and one declaration counts
once however many selected records resolved it. Anything withdrawn or
superseded at the asked-for knowledge instant is set aside first, and named:
only what stands can contradict anything, and a difference a supersession
already resolved is not a contradiction. Each remaining pair is then
measured and tested.

| | |
|---|---|
| Method | `notationsos.position-separation.v1` |
| Metric | `WGS84_ELLIPSOIDAL_GEODESIC` — Vincenty's inverse solution on the WGS84 ellipsoid; it refuses rather than returning the last iterate where it does not converge |
| Test | Whether the two stated uncertainty radii can contain one common point |

Three answers, accented on the same two tiers as the rest of the estate.
`DISJOINT` is a decision — these accounts cannot both be right, and where the
subject is has not been settled — and is accented as one. `NOT_ASSESSABLE`
is unresolved and takes amber: a declaration that states no horizontal
uncertainty is not compared, and no radius is assumed to compare it, so one
untestable pair leaves the whole set untested rather than consistent.
`OVERLAPPING` is deliberately plain, not green: it is not a positive
finding, and colouring it as one would say the sources agree.

The surface prints what the answer is not, in full, beside it. The three
that matter most: the separation is a geodesic and not a route or a travelled
distance; the sources state a radius and no distribution, so no probability
is computed and none is implied; and **overlapping radii are not agreement —
a shared location is never on its own a reason to treat two subjects as
one.** Co-location is evidence about where things are, never on its own an
identity decision. A disagreement here is a question for adjudication, not
an answer.

**Declarations are counted, and sources are counted separately**, because
they are not the same number. Three overlapping declarations from one source
are one account restated, not a threefold agreement, and the finding says so.
Two sources that disagree with each other read differently from one source
that contradicts itself, and that too is named.

The limit is stated rather than worked around: **distinct sources are not
independent sources.** Two sources republishing one original measurement
declare twice and observe once, and a position record carries no lineage that
would show it — so nothing here can tell corroboration from syndication, and
agreement between sources is never counted as evidence. Overlap remains the
absence of a contradiction, never the presence of support.

Across everything placed, the count of subjects whose standing declarations
cannot all be right is itself a finding, and is shown as one.

## Local engine package boundary

`scripts/earth-assets.mjs` delegates to the server/build-only `src/earth/assets.mjs`. Preparation requires the installed and declared CesiumJS version to match the exact 1.124.0 pin. It inventories the module, workers, widgets, assets and third-party files, and copies `LICENSE.md`, `ThirdParty.json` and `ThirdParty.extra.json` alongside them. `public/cesium/VERSION.json` is a versioned manifest with sorted paths, byte lengths, per-file SHA-256 hashes, total bytes and a manifest digest.

Preparation creates an exclusive local lock, copies into a new staging directory, verifies the full staged package and publishes it by rename. A matching existing bundle is verified and reused without writes. An incomplete, altered, old-format or different existing bundle is refused and **preserved**, never silently deleted or repaired. Only the preparer's own unpublished temporary tree is cleaned up after failure. The verifier rejects links/junctions, unknown files, malformed paths and oversized files or trees. The Earth server page verifies the manifest against all published file bytes before allowing the engine to load; a version stamp alone cannot make the viewer ready.

These hashes establish local package consistency, **not independent verification**, source rights, browser-side cryptographic attestation or protection against a privileged writer changing the installation. The published assets and manifest must remain read-only to untrusted processes. Publication assumes a trusted local filesystem and cooperating preparers: the lock and final existence check do not make `rename` an unconditional no-replace primitive against unrelated writers on every platform. No network request, corpus mutation or provider registration is involved. Build tracing also checks that `/earth` does not package `.payload`, `.stamp`, `.git`, environment files or unrelated native compiler output.

**Existing v0 cache / recovery:** stop local dev/build processes first. Preserve an invalid `public/cesium` directory outside `public` in an explicitly selected backup location; confirm that exact target before moving it. Then run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm run earth:assets` with the repository's lockfile. Do not move a bundle while another process serves or prepares it. A leftover `.stamp/earth-assets.lock` after interruption requires confirming there is no active preparation and preserving/removing that exact stale lock explicitly; the preparer never breaks another process's lock. No automated migration deletes an existing cache.

## A view is a link

The camera serializes into the URL hash as `#v=longitude,latitude,height,heading,pitch`, fixed precision, always the same five numbers. Loading a link restores the view. The codec is bounded (height between 1 km and 100,000 km, pitch at or below the horizon) and a hash that is not exactly a bounded view is ignored whole, never clamped or salvaged, as God's Eye View treats a malformed share link. Presets: the global view, and the sub-solar point.

## What was adopted from God's Eye View, and what was not

Adopted: the CesiumJS globe with the widget chrome off and the credit line kept visible; the layer discipline; a view as a link; the named list of sources it reads, as a registry. Not adopted: Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles and every keyed or metered provider (the twin runs without any key); the live feeds (each would enter through the acquisition rail); the bundled third-party datasets under non-permissive terms (not copied); voice control and the realtime agent.

The twin therefore makes no request that leaves its origin. The browser test asserts it: every request the page makes is same-origin, `blob:` or `data:`.

## What the design does not bend

- The globe is not evidence. Bundled imagery and a computed sun are context; the inspector says so in the twin's non-claims.
- No position is invented. A record is drawn only where its own subject's `location.position` record declares, under the same gate as the record; a sample is not placed at its lot, nothing is interpolated or geocoded, and a record without a declaration is not drawn, with the compiler's refusal shown beside it. Where two sources disagree, both are drawn, each in its source's colour.
- No signal is live. The registry names sources and their terms; it collects nothing, and each entry says why it is not on the globe.
- No key, no external request. The engine and its imagery are served from this origin; the test proves the absence of any other request.
- The compiler decides. The twin holds no copy of the corpus and no second gate; it inherits refusals and shows their codes.
- Geometry is read, never resolved. The one derivation over the drawn positions says whether standing accounts can all be right; it computes no probability, assumes no uncertainty a source did not state, and never treats a shared location as a reason to treat two subjects as one.

## Verification receipt, v1 (2026-09-05, frontend branch)

**As data** (`src/domain/earth.test.ts`, 5 tests): the origin pin and engine; every layer with source, terms, draws and a state from the closed vocabulary, only the bundled surface, the computed sun and the declared corpus layer drawing anything; the twenty-one registry entries, all `NOT_INTEGRATED`, each with terms, attribution and blockers, with the non-commercial and metered cases adding theirs; the view codec round trip and the rejection of thirteen malformed hashes; the GLOBE request accepted by the closed projection parser and the compiler's answers read without inventing geometry. `src/domain/doctrine.test.ts` binds each engine's stated presence to the installed dependencies both ways. In the compiler (`src/projection/projection.test.ts`, `src/app/api/projections/preview/route.test.ts`): a record placed only where its own subject declares a position under the same gate, valid time and knowledge time gating the position separately from the record, the self-reported declaration returned as such, a sample never placed at its lot, the map route resolving the same declarations and the evidence route carrying none, and the endpoint returning the position through the closed parser with the same digest discipline.

**Over a mocked engine** (`src/components/earth/EarthTwin.test.tsx`, 27 tests after the foundation merge below, 3 of them for placement): the assets-missing state with its remedy; a keyless start from bundled imagery with the ion token cleared; every layer's state; the GLOBE request for one record with the release's knowledge time and the record's validity start, the refusal shown, and a refused record shown as refused; world time following the selection; the sub-solar point computed and labelled; the camera writing a bounded hash when it stops, presets flying the camera, a bad hash ignored; a record drawn at every position its subject declares, one entity per declared position in the declaring source's interest colour with the ring only where an uncertainty is stated, the camera flown above the first position when the record is chosen and not on first load; every record placed on request with one request per record at its own validity start, the placed, unplaced and refused counts reported, and two records at one position sharing one point and one label; a click on a drawn point selecting a record placed there without moving the camera, and a click on nothing changing nothing.

**In the browser** (`tests/e2e/earth.spec.ts`, desktop and Pixel 7, against the built application and the real CesiumJS on software WebGL): status `READY` with the renderer named; the canvas visible; the five layers with their states; twenty-one registry entries, none integrated; the compiler's `GEOMETRY_NOT_AVAILABLE` for the first record and a refusal or unavailability for the last; the sub-solar point computed; the hash written after a flight, restored from a link, and a malformed hash ignored; the draft-survey record of lot 5B-221 placed at the berth its port custody record declares, with the source, its interest, the stated 250 m and the camera flown there, the hash carrying the berth; every record offered placed on request with nine placed, nine unplaced and none refused (the records this viewer may not select are never offered), the yard-log declaration listed as self-reported when a lot 7C-104 record is chosen from the placed list; no horizontal overflow; no serious or critical axe findings; no page errors; and no request leaving the origin. `/earth` is in the overflow guard and the screenshot set (`docs/screenshots/00j-earth-twin.png`, and `00k-earth-twin-placed.png` with every placeable record drawn and the camera at the berth). Whole suites after the change, on the frontend branch before the merge: typecheck, lint, 1732 unit tests (the pinned GAT runtime tests excluded, their engine pin being `win32`), `next build`, 118 regular Playwright tests at desktop and Pixel 7, 10 real-kernel tests, screenshots regenerated.

**Not done.** Only declared positions are drawn, and the demonstration corpus declares two; no track, extent or motion is declared, so none is drawn, and the stages above say what would put an observed geography on the globe and who decides. The bundled imagery is coarse. The registry is a copy of a document at a commit, not a live read of it. The engine's own credit line is rendered by the engine.

## Foundation integration verification (2026-09-05, Windows)

Integrated frontend head `9aab8a7` by fast-forward into `codex/payload-os-foundation`, preserving the bounded FMCSA source work. This increment changes local asset verification, server-side record metadata delivery and asynchronous viewer/request ownership. It does not authorize stages v1–v3.

- `npm run check`: 29 Rust tests, typecheck, lint and 1,850 JavaScript tests passed; six optional GAT tests were excluded from that default run. New coverage includes 64 synthetic-package asset tests, 16 selector tests and 21 additional viewer/request tests (24 component tests total).
- `npm run build`: passed, including the Earth page's deployment-trace check. `npm run earth:assets` created then reused the same verified 377-file / 10,765,930-byte package, digest `sha256:ea46ee4be254297b1a76be4e83c39de02d0e11997a026ea41ca2ff2281747d4f`. This is a local integrity receipt, not independent attestation.
- Installed Edge, desktop and Pixel 7 emulation: 118 regular browser tests passed; 18 environment/device-specific cases were skipped by that configuration. The Earth test separately passed on both viewports and again in the full suite: real CesiumJS, same-origin requests only, verified manifest, withheld IDs absent from HTML/RSC and selector, explicit geometry refusal, clocks, camera links, no page errors, no horizontal overflow and no serious/critical axe findings outside the WebGL canvas. The Windows renderer was NVIDIA/ANGLE, not the original Linux software renderer. Both screenshots were visually inspected; local artifacts are under `.stamp/earth-browser-results/` and are not deployment assets.
- `node scripts/state-kernel-e2e.mjs`: 10 real-kernel browser tests passed in isolated temporary history. `GAT_INTEGRATION=1 node scripts/production-e2e.mjs`: all three real HTTP production tests passed, including the pinned GAT audit.
- `GAT_INTEGRATION=1 npx vitest run src/gat/runtime.test.ts src/gat/service.test.ts --no-file-parallelism`: all 67 tests passed, including the six optional cases. An initial parallel invocation returned `ENGINE_BUSY` in two service cases because both files used the same exclusive runtime; the serial invocation respects that existing lock. The scientific import guard's five Python tests also passed.

Existing evidence and coordination history hashes remained unchanged. No live Earth source was contacted; no source approval, fixture geometry, canonical identity, release digest, kernel command or customer-delivery deployment was added.

## Merge receipt (2026-09-05, frontend branch, Linux)

Merged `codex/payload-os-foundation` 9e03a15 into the frontend branch on top of Earth Twin v1 (3a6bd53) and reconciled to one implementation: the runtime-isolated component carries the placement state, the click-to-select handler under the instance guard, the drawing effect keyed on the active viewer instance, and the place-every-record flow; the projection effect keeps the serialized-request identity and adds placement and the flight on resolve. Codex's viewer and request tests and the placement tests run on one fake engine (27 component tests). The record-choices test now expects `READY` where a choice's own subject declares a position and `UNAVAILABLE` otherwise, since every offered choice is selectable and the compiler decides geometry. The browser test carries both sides: the verified manifest, the absence of withheld identities from the document and the selector, and the placement flow, whose place-all count is nine placed, nine unplaced and none refused because the withheld records are never offered.

Verified after the merge: typecheck; lint; 1833 unit tests (the pinned GAT runtime tests excluded, their engine pin being `win32`); the verified package prepared from the pinned engine by `npm run earth:assets` (digest `sha256:ea46ee4b…`, 377 files, 10,765,930 bytes, the same digest the foundation branch recorded on Windows), after the v0-format bundle was moved out of `public` rather than deleted; `next build` with the Earth trace check; 118 regular Playwright tests at desktop and Pixel 7 on software WebGL; 10 real-kernel tests; the placed screenshot regenerated (`docs/screenshots/00k-earth-twin-placed.png`, showing 0 refused).

## Re-verification receipt (2026-09-06, frontend branch, Linux container)

Reproduced v1 at `efeb70a` on a fresh Linux x86_64 clone (Node 22.22.2, Rust 1.94.1, Python 3.11.15, software WebGL), without local changes:

- `npm ci --ignore-scripts`; `npm run earth:assets` created the verified package from the pinned engine: 377 files, 10,765,930 bytes, digest `sha256:ea46ee4be254297b1a76be4e83c39de02d0e11997a026ea41ca2ff2281747d4f`, the same digest the Windows foundation run and the Linux merge run recorded.
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`: clean.
- `npm test` (Rust kernel build, production worker build, vitest): 1841 passed, 6 skipped, 14 failed, every failure in `src/gat/runtime.test.ts` reporting the pinned GAT engine unavailable before any assertion, as the earlier Linux receipts describe (the engine pin is `win32`). Excluding that file: 80 files, 1833 passed, 2 skipped.
- `npm run build`: passed, including the trace check that `/earth` packages no local history, runtime installation or compiler scratch.
- Playwright against the built application on the pre-installed Chromium: the Earth test on desktop and Pixel 7 (real CesiumJS, same-origin requests only, verified manifest, withheld identities absent, explicit geometry refusal, clocks, camera links, placement of every offered record, no page errors, no overflow, no serious or critical axe findings); then the whole regular suite, 118 passed and 18 skipped; then `node scripts/state-kernel-e2e.mjs`, 10 real-kernel tests passed in isolated temporary history.

This is a local reproduction receipt on one more platform, not independent attestation. No source was contacted; no fixture, geometry, identity, release digest or kernel command changed.

## What the twin opens on, and what it folds

Three things measured on the built page, then fixed.

**It landed empty.** The default selection was the first deliverable record — a
sample's moisture, whose subject the release does not position — so a reader
arrived at a globe with nothing on it under a red `GEOMETRY_NOT_AVAILABLE`. True
about that record, and a poor first question to have asked on the reader's
behalf. `earthRecordChoices` now marks each choice with `positionDeclared`, and
the twin opens on the first record whose subject the release positions.

That flag is a hint and nothing more: it says a position record exists for the
subject, not that the compiler will place this record. The compiler still
decides, on the exact version, at the asked-for clocks, under the viewer's
rights — and where the release positions nothing, the twin falls back to the
first record and the refusal is the honest landing state. A link that names a
record still wins over both.

**Two sections were most of the column.** The layer list and the twenty-one
source registry ran to about three and a half thousand pixels between them, so
reaching *what is on the globe* meant scrolling past everything the globe is
not. Both are folded now. The counts stay in the summaries — the registry still
reads "21 named, 0 integrated" shut — so folding hides the lists and not the
facts. Visible text on the page fell from 10,885 characters to 7,949, and the
document from 4,380 pixels to 2,514.

**The globe sat in the stage rather than filling it.** At 26,000 km the Earth
subtends about 11° of a 60° field and occupied roughly a third of the frame.
`GLOBAL_VIEW` is now 12,000 km: about 20°, so the disc spans two thirds, with
margin for the terminator and for a placement flying in from an edge.

The e2e that covered this had pinned the old landing — it asserted
`data-outcome: UNAVAILABLE` and `0 placed` on arrival. The refusal is still
tested, one selection away rather than as the state a reader meets: selecting a
sample's moisture draws nothing and says why.

## The operator instrument

The globe is used twice, by two readers who need opposite things from it.

The **display** renders adjudicated truth to a customer. Its failure mode is
fabrication: a smoothed line or a filled gap becomes something a counterparty
relies on, so it must never imply more than the corpus asserts, and refusal is a
rendering state.

The **instrument** renders the factory floor to whoever runs it — the admission
queue, the contested subjects, the places the corpus is ignorant of. Its failure
mode is wasted motion, which is recoverable, so it may be as dense and synthetic
as helps an operator think. That is the same exemption internal tooling has from
an SLO: nobody adjudicates from it.

The exemption is from the display's epistemics and from nothing else, and two
rules make the difference structural rather than cultural.

**It never writes.** No admission, correction, merge or release is initiated
from the cockpit; the instrument navigates and the rails decide. The rule is
about the act, not the HTTP verb — the twin asks the projection compiler for a
placement with a POST, and that is a read expressed as a request body.
`src/domain/operatorInstrument.ts` imports nothing that can write, and its own
test reads the module's source to hold it there, so the guarantee is checked
rather than promised. At the surface the panel offers one kind of control: a
button that selects a record. The component test asserts the whole set.

**It labels its own conveniences.** An instrument may interpolate, smooth,
aggregate and dead-reckon for legibility, and must say where it did — an
operator reading a seamless picture is as misleadable as anyone else. So
`convenience` is required on every layer, `NONE` is the claim that nothing was
smoothed rather than a field somebody forgot, and the first layer that
interpolates has to declare it to compile. Every layer reads `NONE` today, and
the panel says so under *Conveniences taken* rather than leaving the heading out.

There is a third property that is a consequence of the first rather than a rule
of its own, and it is why the integrity blocks stayed where they were: **the
instrument reads through the rights gate, not around it.** Every layer is
counted over `deliverableRecords` for a seat — the twin's is
`COUNTERPARTY_SHARED` — so it flies what a seat may see and is not a way past
what it may not. An internal instrument that quietly read past the gate would be
a rights bypass wearing a cockpit.

### The five layers, and the one worth the exercise

| layer | reads | on the Caravan release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `positioned` | subjects with a standing position this seat can read | 2 |
| `void` | subjects with records and no position | 5 |
| `contested` | subjects with more than one standing declaration | 0 |
| `restated` | records not `CURRENT` at the release's `knownAt` | 3 |
| `admission-queue` | candidates waiting on the gate | `UNKNOWN` |

The queue is `UNKNOWN` and not `0`, for the reason the compression derivation
settled: admission lives at the write boundary, a page holds no store
connection, and an unreadable count is not a zero. The count is a parameter, so
a caller that can read the store passes one and the layer reports it.

**`void` is the layer worth the whole exercise.** A subject the corpus positions
can be flown to; a subject it does not is a hole you cannot fly to, and listing
those holes is SILENCE-IS-NOT-ZERO rendered as terrain. Five of the seven
selectable subjects are holes — every sample in the release has records and no
position — so the reading an operator actually gets is *where this seat is
ignorant*, not where the world is empty. The panel lists them rather than
drawing them, because a hole has no coordinates, and each row still selects the
subject's records: navigation, not admission.

Reading through the gate costs that layer its certainty, and the layer says so
instead of papering over it. From a given seat, a subject with no position may
be one the release never positioned or one it positioned and does not deliver
here. The instrument names both readings and resolves neither — resolving it
would disclose the withholding it is not entitled to disclose.

The concept is [God's Eye View](https://github.com/bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view)'s,
already credited and pinned in `EARTH_TWIN_ORIGIN` at commit `6d83bb6`. What is
adopted here is the posture — a globe you fly rather than a globe you read — not
its code or its signal feeds, which remain `NOT_INTEGRATED` for the reasons the
registry gives.

### Verification (2026-09-07, frontend branch, Linux container)

Typecheck clean; ESLint clean at `--max-warnings=0`; 4,621 unit tests pass (183
files, 6 skipped) — 13 of them new for the derivation and 6 for the panel,
including the structural test that the module imports no store and the surface
test that every button in the panel is a selection, with the page's props test
extended to assert it hands down the same reading; `next build` clean; 178
regular Playwright tests pass at desktop and Pixel 7, with a second axe pass
taken with the section open (the page's own pass runs with it shut, so its
contents are `display:none` and unexamined); screenshot

## The density pass (2026-09-08)

The references are dense with labelled data and the inspector was dense with
prose. Same information, restructured so a reading is a label and a value and
an explanation is one click away.

- **The strip over the globe** keys its readings: `WORLD`, `PLACED`.
- **What this instrument is** folds, with the engine state carried in its rule.
  The renderer string — a hundred characters on a software GPU — stays in the
  body; a rule that carried it wrapped the heading four deep.
- **Time** is three ruled readouts. Sub-solar draws `DERIVED` when the engine
  computed it and `UNKNOWN` when there is no engine to compute it. The two
  clock meanings sit behind one disclosure.
- **Corpus on the globe** opens with a `RELEASE / VIEW / VIEWER` stamp instead
  of a sentence; the outcome word rides in the section rule, coloured from the
  epistemic scale; each declared position is a ruled panel — the identifier
  ruled to the source's interest and standing, the value, the source's own
  basis, and a `SOURCE / CLASS / VALID / KNOWN` stamp — and the legend sentence
  became `WHERE / COLOUR / RING`.
- **Placed on the globe** carries its drawn count in the rule and folds the
  paragraph on how placement works.
- **Operator instrument** lost the paragraph over the void list (the rule and
  the rows say it) and folds its two rules behind the `WRITES NONE` label.
- **View** turned its trailing prose into `ORBIT / ZOOM / LINK`.

The layer pill had a private colour map that drew `UNAVAILABLE` in the refusal
red. A layer the engine cannot supply is an absence, not a gate declining, so
it now draws from the epistemic scale as `UNKNOWN`: dashed grey. Same class of
flattening as the retracted record chip, found the same way.

Every pinned string stayed inside the container its test reads: 136 twin and
primitive unit tests, the earth browser spec at desktop and Pixel 7.

## Events on the globe

A headline is a claim by a source at a publication time. It is never a fact. On
the twin it is a marker at its coordinates, and the card at those coordinates
does not say what the source said — it says where the corpus stands beside it.

That is the difference between this and a news map. A news map renders claims
on a globe. This renders claims against the corpus's adjudicated state: the
disagreement layer, spatialized. A headline that conflicts with the corpus is
the most useful object on the screen — the corpus is thin there, the source is
wrong, or something changed — and each of those is work, so a conflict is
drawn loud: a bigger point, a heavier ring.

### The reading

`src/domain/locatedClaims.ts`. A located claim carries a source, an evidence
class (reported, asserted, interest unknown — the terms the estate already
has), both clocks, a declared origin, a geocode, and what it asserts in the
corpus's own terms — a subject, a predicate, a value and a world time — or
null when it names no predicate this corpus holds.

The geocode is itself an observation. A method produced coordinates and an
uncertainty from text, and it is carried as one: `method` names what ran, and
a drafted specimen says so rather than pretending a geocoder did.

The corpus is asked with `queryAsOf`, `WHAT_WE_HELD`, under the twin's seat,
and the answer or refusal becomes one of four states. **They ride on the check
vocabulary the case checks already use** — `PASSED`, `FAILED`,
`NOT_EVALUATED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE` — with claim-facing labels, rather than a
fifth closed set:

| label | status | means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CORROBORATED` | `PASSED` | inside the record's own stated bounds; two accounts agree |
| `CONFLICTING` | `FAILED` | outside them, or a different categorical value |
| `UNCORROBORATED` | `NOT_EVALUATED` | the record states no bounds and the values differ — no tolerance is assumed — or the only record was withdrawn |
| `NOT_IN_COVERAGE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | the corpus refuses (no record, no identity link, not deliverable) or the headline names no predicate |

CORROBORATED and not CONFIRMED: the estate already holds that a single account
is not corroborated by standing alone. A headline and a record are two accounts
agreeing, which is corroboration, and confirmation is a stronger word than two
accounts earn.

**Both clocks are shown.** A claim is checked against what the corpus held when
the claim was captured and against what it holds at the release cutoff. The
marker draws the current reading; the card shows both. When they differ, the
corpus learned something — the specimen draft-survey headline reads
`CORROBORATED` on 19 August against the carrier's 40.0 t (no bounds, equal)
and `CONFLICTING` now against the weighbridge's 40.12 t [40.08, 40.16], which
became knowable on the 25th. Collapsing the two would be the backfill mistake
the as-of law exists to refuse.

**Never a fake pin.** A geocode with no stated uncertainty is not drawn. A
point without a radius is a precision claim nobody made, and the spatial
derivation already refuses to key such a position. An unplaceable claim is
listed with the reason, can be selected and read, and its card carries the
corpus's check — it simply has nowhere to be flown to.

**The card carries what it needs and nothing the gate withheld.** The
corroboration sends the client a narrow checked-record shape — identifier,
value, bounds, standing, both clocks — and a refusal's code and reason only.
The full as-of answer includes the records a refusal considered, and that list
can name records this seat is not shown.

### The two sources in this slice

- **The ledger.** Every retraction knowable by the release, placed at its
  subject's *last declared* position. Lot 5B-221's position record was valid
  15–18 August and the correction was issued on the 25th; where the lot was on
  the 25th is not held, and the geocode says so. The sample withdrawal has no
  position at all and is listed, not drawn.
- **Drafted specimen headlines** (`src/fixtures/caravan/headlines.ts`), every
  one `DRAFTED_SPECIMEN` from a source named as a specimen and not a
  publication, chosen to land on each state against records the corpus
  actually holds. Five of seven located items are drawn.

No wire adapter exists yet. Collection is the operator's act under the same
flag as every other connector, and reading the news is collection behaviour:
general feeds under a deliberate posture, never targeted ones that would
reveal a watchlist.

### The card is docked, not tracked

The card renders in the inspector, and the marker's label at the coordinates
carries the identifier, the current reading and the headline. A card anchored
to the coordinates and moved every frame is the ancestor's behaviour and a
later step; it needs occlusion handling for markers behind the globe and a
per-frame transform, and neither was worth getting slightly wrong in the first
slice. The label at the coordinates is the part that has to be right.

### Nothing writes

The section's every control is a selection or a flight, and a test asserts the
whole set. If a checked claim ought to become a candidate, that is the intake
rail's decision under its own receipts; the card navigates and the rails decide.
