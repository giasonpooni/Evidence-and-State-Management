# Economic architecture

Current technical positioning and repository naming, 2026-09-20. The
instrumentation mandate extends the existing information-production business.
Earlier economic formulations and dated implementation receipts remain historical
records; they are not current capability claims.

## The firm

Notation Systems develops computational instrumentation and evidence infrastructure
for industrial and cyber-physical systems. Its systems connect observations,
mathematical models, declared computation and governed information. Existing
trade, industrial, infrastructure and risk intelligence remain applications of
that shared substrate.

Evidence and State Management retains source material, time-qualified records,
identity, rights, candidate review, admission, releases, correction and recall.
Scientific Computation Runtime owns declared scientific execution; Computational
Instrumentation Workbench provides instrument sessions, adapters, inspection and
replay. These responsibilities are complementary, and their current repository
locations are listed in the [stack responsibility table](../README.md#stack-responsibilities).

The corpora remain the information inventory from which the firm prepares trade and industrial intelligence packages,
analytics and evidence-backed dossiers. Each package declares fields, coverage,
methods, quality, provenance, version and permitted use. Dossier Services retains
the information-delivery role. APIs, feeds, reports and MCP tools distribute
prepared information; implemented instruments do not themselves establish a
completed commercial delivery.

## Geographic mandate

Notation Systems develops evidence-backed industrial, trade, and infrastructure intelligence across selected markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe—connecting local records and physical observations to cross-border commercial decisions.

This is a geographic specialization beneath the broader firm mandate. We build broad reference coverage across those regions, develop deep evidence around customer-dependent industrial corridors, and sell the maintained decisions those connections support.

## Customer categories

- Manufacturers and Importers
- Logistics and Distributors
- Brokers
- Insurance and financing firms

## Economic architecture

```
Acquire and organize permitted real-world data
→ prepare versioned trade and industrial intelligence packages
→ license the prepared information to customers
→ maintain quality, provenance and correction history
```

Internal computation supports preparation and quality review. Hosted customer computation and principal trading are outside the active offering. Existing source-use, customer-data, redistribution and trading restrictions remain unchanged.

## Product architecture

| Component or line | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Notation Systems | The firm developing computational instrumentation and evidence infrastructure |
| Evidence and State Management | Evidence retention, time-qualified state, admission, rights and release operations, including a local operational terminal |
| Scientific Computation Runtime | Declared scientific workloads and provenance-bearing execution |
| Computational Instrumentation Workbench | Instrument sessions, adapters, inspection and replay |
| Caravan | Logistics, freight, cargo and supply-chain information |
| Tradewind | Markets, instruments, pricing and risk information |
| Landshark | Parcels, zoning, entitlements and development-state information |
| Dossier Services | Curation, compilation and delivery of the information products |

The technical component names do not add domain product lines. HTTP feeds and MCP
tools remain delivery interfaces over the corpora. The licensed package's
information and scope are the customer value; customers can apply their own
inference to what they receive.

This repository includes its existing internal preparation and review terminal;
it is broader than that terminal and does not replace the separate Computational
Instrumentation Workbench. Existing UI labels, package names, contracts and
historical identifiers remain compatible. The rename alone establishes no new
customer-facing software offering.

The retained interface contract, "NotationsOS is the terminal, not a product",
continues to describe the existing terminal label in `src/domain/domains.ts`.
Evidence and State Management names the broader repository responsibility.

## The concise formulation

| Layer | Who supplies it |
|---|---|
| Licensed data and analytics package | The customer product, prepared from the corpus |
| HTTP feed, MCP tool, report | Distribution of the prepared information |
| Model, agent, admission profile, workbench | Internal preparation, quality review and inquiry |

Providing the data interface is sufficient for a customer to use the information. It can expose point-in-time state, lineage, uncertainty, rights, corrections and stable identity. Internal analytics may prepare additional fields under declared methods; buying the data does not require using the firm's workbenches or inference stack.

## The value proposition, kept concrete

- "As-of" answers that reconstruct what was knowable at a specific time.
- Machine-readable uncertainty and validity bounds, not footnotes.
- Certified release manifests and push retractions when a fact changes.
- Provenance that survives downstream use, audit, and resale.
- A customer can automate a decision against the feed without blindly trusting a black box.

## Shared production facilities inside Evidence and State Management

Current implementation boundary: PostgreSQL/Drizzle corpus storage and a guarded
admission writer are wired when configured. Admission, issued-identifier
resolution and world-time rules exist; the supplied-byte statutory harvester
can return admission rulings and as-of results in memory. These are implemented
mechanisms, not evidence of a retained customer inventory or deployed delivery.
All three product lines carry demonstration corpora. One historical bounded
FMCSA capture is documented; Samsara is offline-tested and recurring source
operation is not established. The delivery ledger is specified and empty;
completed customer deliveries, independent verification and a pilot are not
established. See [Statutory harvester](STATUTORY_HARVESTER.md),
[Storage](STORAGE.md) and [Real-source continuity](REAL_SOURCE_CONTINUITY.md).

Two internal facilities are implemented as local rails. Neither is a customer product, and neither creates canonical domain state.

The agent and apparatus stable and shared message board are internal coordination facilities within Evidence and State Management. They record participant definitions and their working contracts, expose compatible connections and missing inputs, and carry scoped requests, handoffs, blockers, results and acknowledgements. A participant inbox and JavaScript/Python clients let local processes coordinate through these records. A manually started local contract-review worker reports declared suppliers and missing inputs, then acknowledges the request. A separate candidate-build-review worker can inspect an exact local build reference and report a bounded historical observation before acknowledging; it grants no retrieval or admission authority. This supports assembly of the shared production system. It does not change the customer categories, make inference a requirement for buying the corpus, or establish managed customer compute. The implementations and present limits are recorded in [Agent coordination](AGENT_COORDINATION.md) and [Candidate-build review worker](CANDIDATE_BUILD_REVIEW_WORKER.md).

The local evidence rail is another shared production facility: it evaluates a declared source policy, captures local bytes with a storage receipt and reopens the acquisition for integrity checks. Its authorization basis is an operator declaration. Capture alone creates no normalized record. A separate local normalization step evaluates INTERNAL DERIVE and parses a fixed Caravan Carrier JSON contract into a source-scoped, unresolved and unadmitted candidate, or persists a quarantine with no candidate. A subsequent local candidate builder assembles explicitly selected candidates under a definition and knowledge cutoff, reopening their evidence and separately evaluating DERIVE at build time. Its manifest remains unadmitted; none of these steps creates canonical domain state, admits a corpus or activates a release. The implementations are documented in [Local evidence intake](LOCAL_EVIDENCE_INTAKE.md), [Local normalization](LOCAL_NORMALIZATION.md) and [Local candidate builds](LOCAL_CANDIDATE_BUILDS.md).

The first [local source connector](LOCAL_SOURCE_CONNECTORS.md) now acquires a bounded FMCSA Company Census response through an operator-only CLI for internal qualification. It preserves original bytes, an immutable request intent and outcome history, with source-scoped observations or quarantine. This is the distinct `fmcsa-company-census` source, not QCMobile or the synthetic Carrier source contract. Its operator-declared qualification policy does not permit customer redistribution. One live qualification capture does not establish recurring ingestion, a public source-connector fleet, a released corpus or a customer live feed.

The [synthesized architecture](SYNTHESIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md) organizes internal responsibilities into Acquisition, Corpus, State, Compute/Decision and Projection fabrics. CesiumJS is installed as the Earth Twin and draws declared fixture geometry through the read-only projection compiler; kepler.gl and Three.js remain routing targets. The small [Rust notation state kernel](LOCAL_NOTATION_STATE_KERNEL.md) implements authored objects, commands, undo/redo and local save/reload. It remains distinct from the admission rules and structured corpus store. Scientific, spatial, custody and settlement experiments are internal research instruments; their existence does not establish an additional commercial offering.

## Rules for this repository

- Name the component's verified engineering responsibility and distinguish it from delivered information products, their scope and licensed use.
- Internal software prepares and inspects packages; its instrument count is not a measure of customer delivery.
- Distinguish implemented mechanisms, demonstrated runs, retained real records, deployed operations and delivered customer products. A gate result or a database dependency alone establishes none of the later stages.
- Preserve source restrictions and historical evidence; a new mandate does not change the authority under which old material was acquired.
- Prioritize a reproducible permitted-source-to-package workflow with review, release, delivery and correction records. The current repository does not establish a completed licensed customer delivery.

## Historical formulation (2026-09-04; superseded)

The following earlier business model is retained as historical context only.
Hosted compute and principal trading below are not current product commitments.

Notation Systems builds provenance-bearing computational corpora: governed, time-bounded information inventory that can be inspected, computed against, corrected, and distributed with its evidence, method lineage, rights, uncertainty, and release history intact.

The firm monetizes this shared computational substrate through two operating businesses:

1. **Data systems and intelligence products.** Notation Systems licenses computational corpora, APIs, feeds, decision workbenches, reports, and vertical applications built on those corpora.
2. **Provenance-preserving compute.** The firm operates managed storage, models, simulations, agents, and computational workloads over authorized corpus releases, allowing customers to execute confidential work without losing lineage, policy, or recallability.

Over time, a separately governed principal-capital activity may deploy the firm's own capital using lawfully acquired and policy-permitted proprietary intelligence. This activity is distinct from customer products: it has separate information-access controls, capital allocation, risk management, reporting, and conflict governance. Customer evidence remains tenant-isolated; customer workloads remain confidential; proprietary strategies cannot draw on restricted customer information.

The underlying production system is shared. The customer-facing API, feed, report, agent, or workbench is not the finished good itself; it is the distribution mechanism for a certified corpus release. The manufacturing analogy makes the moat legible: scraping is extraction; it is not the business. The durable asset is the continuously maintained corpus plus its identity mappings, release history, corrections, and computable interfaces.

## Historical implementation record accompanying the earlier formulation

This table records the earlier milestone and its then-current absences. Later
admission, identity, PostgreSQL, statutory-harvester and Earth Twin work supersedes
its blanket absence statements; use the current boundary above for planning.

The [local production workflow](LOCAL_PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW.md) makes the existing acquisition-to-candidate rail operable through an opt-in loopback API, with configuration records, stage receipts and historical inspection. The [GAT IFC inspector](GAT_INSPECTOR.md) adds a pinned, bounded specialist audit over preserved evidence. The separate [FMCSA Company Census connector](LOCAL_SOURCE_CONNECTORS.md) adds one local operator-only live acquisition path, verified with one 371-byte response for USDOT 80806 on 2026-09-05 and unchanged historical inspection/replay. These are internal local capabilities, not public customer delivery, canonical admission, independent verification or managed customer compute. Only the earlier blanket absence of live connectors has changed; the other five firm-wide absences remain.

| Statement | Where it is implemented | Presence |
|---|---|---|
| Operate one local Caravan production path through supported frontend contracts | `src/production`, `/api/production`, `/api/production/inspect`; [Local production workflow](LOCAL_PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW.md) | Local development implementation: registered definitions/sources, bounded capture, exact retries, evidence inspection, fixed Carrier normalization/quarantine and unadmitted candidate-build inspection. This API has no live or public acquisition controls |

Customer redistribution is not permitted by the qualification policy; provider license remains unresolved. Distinct from QCMobile; no synthetic Carrier adapter compatibility, canonical admission, recurring ingestion or customer live feed |
| Inspect building-model evidence through a pinned specialist engine | `src/gat`, `/api/gat/audits`; [GAT inspector](GAT_INSPECTOR.md) | Local implementation: exact IFC bytes + current declared DERIVE permission → pinned GAT audit → original report/receipt + safe projection. Supported and blocked outcomes; no source-truth, engineering approval, admission or physical-action authority |

| Capture authorized local source material and retain its bytes and receipt | `src/data-os/local-intake.ts`, `source-policy.ts`, `evidence-capture.ts`, `file-object-store.ts`, `local-files.ts`; `npm run evidence -- capture` | Local implementation: exact INTERNAL INGEST evaluated against operator-declared policy; create-only content-addressed files and acquisition metadata; readback and reinspection. Capture alone does not normalize; no independent authorization, canonical admission, physical WORM or production storage claim |

UNADMITTED, with no canonical state, identity resolution, completeness claim, release or public delivery |
| Candidate records stay visible and separate from canonical admission, release and the feed | `/candidates` over `src/fixtures/production/demo.json`, produced through the real rails by `pipeline.ts` and reproduced by `demo.contract.test.ts`; `separationTerms` checked against every feed payload and MCP tool result | Demonstration reproduced under the rails; every record UNADMITTED, identity UNRESOLVED; the page reads no local store |
| The architecture carried forward, bound to this repository: three states of information, the seven rules with their enforcement and tests, verification tiers, the routing table over the one projection router | `src/domain/doctrine.ts`, `src/domain/projection.ts`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (binding) over `docs/SYNTHESIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md` (prose); `/model`; `src/domain/doctrine.test.ts` keeps every named test present; `src/architecture.test.ts` proves rules 5, 6 and 7 structurally; `src/domain/projection.test.ts` checks the table against `routeProjection` for every combination | Stated as data with presence flags; the state kernel and the three projection engines absent, and stated so |
| The first information product, specified, and the promise a delivered record makes | `src/domain/informationProduct.ts` (customer question, subjects, fields with evidence requirements, freshness, permitted uses, correction, acceptance target), `src/domain/deliveredRecord.ts` (ten questions mapped to payload fields); `/products`; both held to the corpus and the feed by their tests | Specified against the demonstration corpus; the acceptance target's admission and release-from-candidates steps stated as not reached |

Browser milestone verified on desktop/mobile. Not canonical corpus admission, independent verification, production permissions/storage or a Bevy runtime |
| A dependable local inquiry workspace: drafts that survive navigation and reload, three states told apart, conflicts kept inspectable, capacity explained, and the evidence-reference contract ahead of its backend | `src/components/notations/*`, `src/domain/evidenceReference.ts`, `src/fixtures/notations/`; [Notation workspace](NOTATION_WORKSPACE.md) | Frontend over the real kernel and store, verified on desktop and mobile; evidence references are fixture-marked with attachment DISABLED until the requested backend commands exist |
