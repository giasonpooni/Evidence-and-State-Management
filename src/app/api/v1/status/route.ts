/**
 * WHAT THIS RESPONSE READS, AND WHAT IT MERELY DECLARES.
 *
 * Three of its `records` counts were literal zeros sitting in the same object
 * literal as three computed array lengths, so a caller could not tell which
 * numbers were readings. This process has no admission store — the console at /
 * answers UNKNOWN for exactly that reason — and a confident zero about a store
 * you cannot reach is the worst thing a status page can say about itself.
 *
 * Six of the seven rungs below carry a status word beginning with VERIFIED,
 * and not one of them verifies anything at request time: no compiler runs, no
 * route is probed, no curl chain executes. They are assertions about what CI
 * established, so they live under a key that says so, with the party that
 * asserted them named. The rung numbers and the detail text are unchanged; only
 * the claim about who checked them is.
 *
 * `runtime_security` is the same kind of thing. Nothing here inspects the
 * process, its listening socket or what stands in front of it, so those fields
 * are the operator's declaration of the intended deployment, marked as such.
 * The proxy topology it declares is also why src/coordination/http.ts refuses a
 * relayed request outright.
