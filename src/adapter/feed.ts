/**
 * Feed payloads: the JSON a customer's own inference reads.
 *
 * Every payload is deterministic, names the release it was served from, and
 * states what was withheld and why. The route handlers under src/app/api/v1
 * are thin wrappers over these functions so tests can call them directly.
 *
 * `fixture_only` is asked of the material, not of the connection. A committed
 * demonstration corpus seeded into a live PostgreSQL and served over a live
 * connection is still a demonstration corpus, and a payload that dropped the
 * marker because of where the bytes were stored would be making exactly the
 * claim this system exists to refuse. The corpus, the release and the case
 * bundle each carry `fixture_only` as a field on the row; those fields are
 * what is read. Where no row can answer, the source's declaration of itself is
 * the fallback, and it falls in the safe direction.
