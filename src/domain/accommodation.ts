/**
 * What the last stretch of work added, and what the rest of the system now
 * has to accommodate.
 *
 * Roughly twenty modules landed in a short time: the spatial derivations, the
 * sensor families, the constraint and factor-graph estimation layer, the
 * invariant filters, the vessel and the port set, the carrier and congruence,
 * the serving boundary, the actuarial correspondence, the legacy-trade
 * backfill, the scene and manifold projection tiers. Each states what exists
 * and what does not. None of them says what the *system* now owes as a
 * consequence, and that is a different question — the one worth asking when a
 * lot has been added quickly.
 *
 * This module answers it in the only way that survives: as data with a test
 * over it, so a capability that quietly becomes runnable stops being listed as
 * blocked, and a precondition that quietly stops being met is caught rather
 * than remembered wrongly.
 *
 * Three findings fall out of the arrangement rather than being asserted by it,
 * and the first was a surprise the probes produced rather than a claim written
 * in advance.
 *
 * The corpus already contains exactly one independently corroborated quantity.
 * Lot 5B-221's gross weight is claimed twice by two different sources: a draft
 * survey at 40.0 t stating no bound at all, and a terminal weighbridge at
 * 40.12 t stating ±0.040 t. That is the seed of everything the estimation layer
 * describes — and under this system's own rule the pair is *not assessable*,
 * because a channel that states no uncertainty is not compared and none is
 * assumed for it. So the corpus holds one disagreement, and it is the kind that
 * cannot be adjudicated. That is a sharper statement of the gap than any count
 * of modules: what is missing is not a second account, it is a second account
 * that stated its own bound.
 *
 * The second is that the gap is narrower than the module count suggests. Almost
 * every unmet precondition below is of one kind — corpus content — and they are
 * variations on that same theme: a position observed twice, an event claimed by
 * two channels, two accounts that can actually be tested against each other.
 * The system is not twenty things away from working. It is one kind of thing
 * away, twenty times.
 *
 * The third is that the additions were mostly cheap for the existing system to
 * absorb, and the few that were not are named in PRESSURE. A module that only
 * declares costs nothing. A module that changes what an existing caller must
 * say — the third clock is the clear case — costs every caller, and that debt
 * is real whether or not anyone writes it down.
 *
 * Nothing here acquires anything, and no capability below is claimed to run.
