/**
 * The admission authority: the gate that is owed.
 *
 * Two places in this repository already name its absence as a live risk
 * rather than a settled sequence. `storage.ts` says the records store
 * arrived first, so "nothing yet stops an unadmitted candidate being written
 * into a releases or records row as though it were a version, and that gate
 * is what the store still needs." `correction.ts` says a corrected record
 * cannot reach back to the build that proposed it, and that closing it needs
 * "an admission authority ... in a place that does not leak rail identifiers
 * into the release."
 *
 * This is that gate, and it is built to those two statements rather than to
 * a fresh idea. Three properties follow from doctrine rather than from
 * preference:
 *
 * Refusal is the default. A check that cannot be evaluated fails. Nothing is
 * admitted because a process computed it (rule 4), and nothing is admitted
 * because nobody objected.
 *
 * Admission is an act with an author. Rule 7 says promotion is an act at a
 * boundary, with a record — so a ruling names the authority that made it,
 * and this module refuses to be its own authority. An automatic admission is
 * not an admission; it is a write.
 *
 * Ancestry lives outside the release. Rule 2 keeps candidate, build and run
 * identifiers out of every release, and a correction still has to reach the
 * build. So the ruling ledger holds the join, the release holds none of it,
 * and `releaseLeaks` is the check that says so rather than the comment.
