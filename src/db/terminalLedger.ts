/**
 * What a terminal asked for, in the database.
 *
 * `src/domain/terminalPlane.ts` decides every ask and returns a receipt, and
 * until now that was the whole of it: the receipt went back to the caller and
 * nowhere else. A pattern of asking was therefore visible to whoever held the
 * call and invisible to the system, which is exactly backwards for a substrate
 * whose own doctrine says that every caller is a source — an identified party
 * whose requests are recorded and whose declared purposes accumulate a history
 * like any other declarations (`src/domain/servingBoundary.ts`).
 *
 * This is where they accumulate. Three tables and the guards that make them
 * mean something.
 *
 * THE CAPABILITY REGISTRY IS A TABLE, NOT A CHECK
 *
 * `terminal_capability` holds one row per capability the substrate declares,
 * seeded from `src/domain/capabilityRegistry.ts`. It could have been a CHECK
 * over 161 quoted strings; a table is better, because the guards below need to
 * reason about a capability's kind and whether it reaches an estate, and a
 * CHECK cannot. A call naming a capability the registry does not describe has
 * no row to point at, which is the same refusal the plane makes, held a second
 * time by the database for a writer that never heard of the plane.
 *
 * A SESSION IS THE DECLARATION, AND IT CANNOT WIDEN
 *
 * `terminal_session` holds the declaration: the party, its class, one purpose
 * from the corpus's own permitted uses, the corpora it named and the window it
 * stands for. The (class, purpose) pairs are generated from
 * `declarablePurposes`, so a customer terminal declaring internal research is
 * a row the database refuses rather than a rule somebody remembered. The row
 * is written once: a widening is a new session a party is answerable for, and
 * an UPDATE is the escalation-inside-one that the whole design refuses.
 *
 * A CALL IS DATED INSIDE ITS SESSION'S WINDOW
 *
 * `served_call` holds one row per ask, admitted, refused or proposed. The
 * session's window is denormalised onto the call and tied back by composite
 * key, so the CHECK that a call happened while its session stood is about the
 * window that session actually declared. The three outcomes each carry what
 * they must and nothing they must not: a refusal carries its code, a proposal
 * carries its proposal, an admission carries neither.
 *
 * AN OPERATE CANNOT BE RECORDED AS ANSWERED
 *
 * The rule the plane enforces is enforced here too, from the capability's
 * kind: only a READ may be ADMITTED. A row saying an operate was served is a
 * row the database does not accept, whatever produced it. An ADMIT capability
 * is refused to any session that is not the firm's own, by the same means.
 *
 * AND THE PROPOSAL IS THE ONE THE CALL MADE
 *
 * A proposed call points at `operation_proposal` in the execution ledger,
 * which is where a governed act has always started. Two guards keep the two
 * rows honest about each other: the proposal's `operation_kind` is the
 * capability that was asked for, and its `counterparty` is the terminal that
 * asked. A proposal cannot be pointed at by a call for a different act, or by
 * a call from a different party.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not meter or price. The fields a bill line needs are here — a party,
 * a request, a served instant — because they are the fields a rights decision
 * needs, but nothing counts them and no rate exists to count them against.
 *
 * It does not authenticate. `terminal_id` is asserted by whatever opened the
 * session. The ledger records who a caller said it was, which is what makes a
 * false claim answerable later, and is not the same as knowing.
 *
 * And nothing can be authorized. A proposal recorded here waits on a decision
 * packet, a review and an `execution_authorization` — and that last row names
 * a corpus release by foreign key, of which there are none. Every operate ask
 * a terminal makes is recordable and unauthorizable, which is the honest state
 * of the substrate and not a gap in this file.
